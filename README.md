# DiamondDice
## Django web development learning project. 

#### Overview 
DiamondDice is a personal twist on  a game called 'Dice 10,000' (also known as 'Ten Grand' or  'Dix-Mille'), a popular dice games in some countries. This game is played with 5 dice. Dice can be rolled until one player reaches the score 10,000, hence the original name. The part about the diamonds is not part of the original rules. It was added to buildd a solo player web version. The player can roll the dice and accumulate points so long as there are coins remaining. Once the player has reached 10,000 points she gets one Gemstone. The game is played until the player has enough points to get a diamond.
