# DiamondDice
Django web development learning project. 
 DiamondDice is a twist on 'Dice 10,000' (also known as 'Ten Grand' or  'Dix-Mille'),a popular dice games in some countries. This game is played with 5 dice. Dice can be rolled until one player reaches the score 10,000, hence the original name. The part about the diamond is not part of the original rules. It was added to the solo player web version.
